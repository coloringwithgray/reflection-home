            Reflections of You is our inaugural fragrance at Coloring with Gray, designed to embody the art of collaboration. This "second skin" scent blends seamlessly with your natural chemistry, creating a unique and personal aroma. While it shines on its own, its true magic happens when it interacts with your skin, developing a fragrance that is distinctly yours. With Reflections of You, you become a co-creator, adding your unique essence to our art.

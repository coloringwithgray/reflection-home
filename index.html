                    Reflection of (you) is our inaugural fragrance at Coloring with Gray, designed to embody the art of collaboration which we believe is inevitable. This "second skin" scent blends seamlessly with your natural chemistry, creating a unique and personal aroma. While it shines on its own, its true magic happens when it interacts with your skin, developing a fragrance that is distinctly yours. With Reflection of (you), you become a co-creator, adding the unique essence to our art.
